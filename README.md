# Pricing
the pricing method controls where the risk sits between you and the client

## 1) fixed price

fixed price
: a single fixed dollar amount the client agrees to pay upon delivering the well defined and documented requirements.

pros:
- the cost does not reflect the time
- this is common and gives client a clear figure to justify
- you lock in the agreed upon price
- client can't alter scope w/o altering price
- customary to get payment upfront (ex: 30%, 50%, 100%)

cons:
- profit margin is reliant on estimation skills
- must pre-emptively factor in risk up-front which can be tricky with new clients or tech
- profit is gained from getting the project done with haste which can hurt a strong client relationship
- time and cost overruns can lead to hard convos with client as they are not obligated to pay any more than what was agreed too
- can pit client against vendor because every small scope change is a 'no' or price alteration leading to a very transactional relationship

## 2) time and materials

time & materials pricing
: client is charged for all of the time spent (per /hour, /day, /week, /month) on project and any material costs (ex: domain reg, third-party software used) incurred. Once the price per/x is agreed too you still give a ballpark time estimate.

pros:
- profit based on the margin built into rate directly
- risk is not all on vendor like it is with fixed pricing
- client has more flexibility to adjust (add/remove) features
- all additionall feature changes are paid for
- can invoice regularly based on work completed over a period of time
- easier to spin into an ongoing retainer


cons:
- reputation depends on yo estimation skills
- the pricing is more transparent
- some clients only accept fixed pricing
- need to regularly communicate project status to avoid the client from getting and larger than expected invoice
- if client isn't satisfied with progress they can stop paying at anytime
- increased project management overhead compared to fixed price (ex: time tracking, sprint planning, more invoicing)
- time overruns for technical issues can be costly for the client

## 3) hybrid: fixed price + T&M

hybrid pricing
: starts with the same fixed pricing approach, in-depth scoping phase, thorough estimation w/buffer and set single price. Any additional enhancements outside of the og scope are charged on a T&M rate which should be agreed to at the start.

## 4) value based

value based pricing
: charge the client a percentage of the estimated profits (savings) which decouples the time from cost. This requires knowledge of business preformance and insights into how the project would affect their bottom line (some kind of project workshop interaction).

pros:
- potential for significantly increasing price
- lower psychological barrier, as client sees profits from their own forcasts
- transparency and real data about financial expectations
- decouples value from time - relationship more valuable than hourly rate

cons:
- far less common pricing model - requires cooperation from the business
- relies on financial projections
- requires more work up front to determine projections based on real data
- not a good fit for companies with unstable profits

## 5) equity and profit share

equity share
: given shares of the business, generally in return for discounted development cost. Money is only made from these shares when:
1. business distributes dividends
2. business is acquired (sold)
3. business IPOs (goes public)
4. you sell your shares

profit share
: receive X percent of the business profits for Y number of years

pros:
- potentially making more money than developing for a set cost
- could allow for expanding your portfolio
- more involved in project due to the ongoing financial stake
- potential for more ongoing work since a financial relationship has been established

cons:
- need to thoroughly understand the business plan and trust the people carrying it out
- may never recoup the money that was discounted for development
- could put undue stress on the relationship (ex: blame game)
- may cause financial strain since you are gambling cash/time for a future payout
- company could reinvest all profits back into the business
- with profit share, a liquidity event may never happen or take a very long time
